 Intelligent systems are designed to detect and react as the data evolves. An intelligent system is one that is always learning, lives in the workflow and is constantly improving. In the modern data world, an application that is not getting more intelligent is getting dumber.  Intelligent applications are designed to detect and react when data distributions evolve. As a result, they need to be “on the wire” to detect those phenomena before they become a problem.  Too many solutions provide an answer in a point of time; an intelligent system is one that is always learning through the framework outlined here. This is what defines intelligence—not a machine learning algorithm kicking out PDFs containing predictions or the results of a data scientist’s work. For the industry to continue to grow and evolve, we need to start doing a better job of recognizing what is truly AI and what is not.
